It was presented at the Applied ML Day [conference](https://www.appliedmldays.org/) in the students projects.

## Presentation of the project
Historical awareness is a crucial condition to understand nowadays political crises. For example, current migration crises in Europe and in the Middle East can be better understood and coped with knowing the African political landscape, which is closely tied to decade-long conflicts. This projectâ€™s aim was to create an interractive way to get acquainted with the major crises that have taken place in the most recent history, from the end of the Cold War until today.
